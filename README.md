## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Server)
The backend is built with Node.js and Express and uses SQLite as the database.

1. Navigate to the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. (Optional) Seed the database with sample recipes:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```


### Frontend (Client)
1. Navigate to the client folder:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will typically run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Running Frontend & Backend Simultaneously

To streamline development, you can run both servers concurrently:

1. From the **project root**, install `concurrently`:
   ```bash
   npm install concurrently --save-dev
   ```

2. Update your root `package.json` with the following scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node server/index.js",
     "seed": "node server/seed.js",
     "dev": "concurrently \"npm run start --prefix server\" \"npm run start --prefix client\""
   }
   ```

3. Start both servers together:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ✅ Final Steps
- Visit the frontend at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Ensure the backend API is working at: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
